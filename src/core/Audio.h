// Why a native engine instead of letting the Chromium layer play the sounds:
// these are reactions to the physics, and they have to land on the frame that
// caused them. A pop fires from a gear change detected on the game thread; the
// UI layer is a whole process away, with JSON and a message queue in between.
// Chromium is the right place for interface sounds, not for engine noises.
//
// XAudio2 is loaded at run time (LoadLibrary), so the build does not depend on
// a particular SDK version being installed. XAudio2_9 ships with Windows 10+;
// the older ones are there as a fallback.
