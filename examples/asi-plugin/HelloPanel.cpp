// HelloPanel - a native .asi mod with an HTML interface, and no JavaScript.
//
// It is the smallest thing that shows the whole shape of the host API: connect
// to SpeedLoader, open a panel, push numbers into it, and answer what the page
// sends back. Build it with the project (target HelloPanel), then put
// HelloPanel.asi in the game's scripts\ folder and ui.html in
// scripts\HelloPanel\.
//
// A real mod would drive this from the game loop it already hooks. This one
// runs a thread of its own instead, precisely because it is worth showing that
// the calls are safe from anywhere: only the callback is pinned to the game
// thread, and SpeedLoader is the one that pins it.
